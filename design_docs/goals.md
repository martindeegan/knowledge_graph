# Implementation Goals

## 1. Hello World MCP Server

**Objective**: Basic MCP server that connects with Claude Desktop

**Deliverables**:

* Minimal `mcp_server.py` that starts and responds to Claude Desktop
* CLI tool for basic testing and local interaction
* Implement a tool named `hello_world` that returns "Hello World!"
* MCP configuration for Claude Desktop integration
* Verification that the connection works

**Success Criteria**:

* Claude Desktop can connect to and invoke tools from the knowledge engine server
* The `hello_world` tool can be invoked from both the CLI and LLM interface and returns "Hello World!"

## 2. MVP Implementation - Self-Documenting Knowledge Graph

**Objective**: Knowledge graph that can document itself and be accessed from Claude Desktop

**Core Features**:

* **Self-Documentation**: Entire project documented by Claude using Cursor.

  * Add a `bootstrap` tool that imports all project files as resource nodes, connecting them according to the directory structure.
  * The graph should serve as graph-based documentation; traversing the graph and reading concept contents should allow a user (or LLM) to understand what the system is doing.
* **Claude Desktop Access**: Full access to knowledge graph from Claude Desktop
* **Design Document Generation**: Generate comprehensive design documents without code access
* **Live Visualization**: Complete visualization tools for Active Context

  * Visualization may update with every change or be batched (e.g., on a timer).
* **Basic Relation Weights**: All relations have constant weight of 1
* **Editing Support**: All editing operations (add/edit/delete nodes and relations) should be supported in the MVP; no guardrails initially.
* **LLM Autonomy**: The MCP client (LLM or user) should have full autonomy to modify the local graph structure.
* **Error Correction**: If the LLM/user makes an invalid or inconsistent edit, the system should allow later correction rather than enforce strict validation.
* **Graph Initialization**: The knowledge graph should be initialized with a concept node at `concept://ws/project` as the root, and linked to the KE config.
* **Documentation Content**: Concepts should distill concise, high-level ideas. For code references, only summarize the ideaâ€”implementation details should be found in linked resource nodes.

**Deliverables**:

* Full implementation of core MCP tools (`context`, `traverse`, `add_concept`, etc.)
* SQLite-based knowledge graph storage with relation weights
* Active Context management with BFS traversal (constant weight 1)
* Self-documented project knowledge base
* Web-based visualization interface for Active Context

**Success Criteria**:

* Claude can document the entire project using the knowledge graph
* Claude Desktop can query and modify the knowledge graph
* Generate design documents using only the knowledge graph (no code access)
* Real-time visualization of what's in Active Context
* `traverse` correctly implements BFS traversal with cost limits

## 2.5. Dynamic Weights Implementation

**Objective**: Add intelligent relation weighting for optimized context loading

**Core Features**:

* **LLM-Controlled Weights**: LLM can set relation weights from 0 to 1
* **Smart Context Loading**: `traverse` uses weighted BFS to optimize Active Context
* **Weight Management Tools**: MCP tools for viewing and modifying relation weights
* **Usage Analytics**: Track which concepts are frequently loaded together

**Deliverables**:

* `set_relation_weight(source_uri, target_uri, weight)` MCP tool
* `get_relation_weights(node_uri)` MCP tool for inspecting weights
* Enhanced `traverse` algorithm with proper weight handling
* Visualization showing relation weights and traversal paths
* Weight optimization suggestions based on usage patterns

**Success Criteria**:

* LLM can set custom weights for relations
* `traverse` respects weight limits and loads optimal context sets
* Visualization shows weight-based relationships clearly
* Frequently co-accessed concepts can be auto-weighted closer to 0

## 3. External Graphs MVP - Local Remote Workspace

**Objective**: Access external knowledge graphs on the local machine

**Core Features**:

* **External Workspace Access**: Connect to knowledge databases on local machine
* **Workspace Linking**: Knowledge Engine workspace can reference external workspaces
* **Cross-Workspace Queries**: Fetch concepts from external knowledge graphs
* **Documentation Example**: Document FastMCP as external knowledge base

**Deliverables**:

* External workspace connection mechanism
* Workspace registry and linking system
* Cross-workspace concept fetching
* FastMCP documentation imported as external knowledge graph

**Success Criteria**:

* Knowledge Engine can access concepts from external local workspaces
* FastMCP documentation accessible via `fetch concept://fastmcp/...`
* Workspace registry manages multiple local knowledge graphs

---

## 4. Remote Graphs MVP - Network Remote Workspace

**Objective**: Access knowledge graphs hosted on remote machines

**Core Features**:

* **Remote Workspace Protocol**: Network protocol for accessing remote knowledge graphs
* **Remote Authentication**: Secure access to remote knowledge databases
* **Network Resilience**: Handle network failures and timeouts gracefully
* **Remote Visualization**: Visualize concepts from remote workspaces

**Deliverables**:

* Network protocol for remote workspace access
* Authentication and security mechanisms
* Remote workspace client/server components
* Extended visualization for remote concepts

**Success Criteria**:

* Knowledge Engine can fetch concepts from remote machines
* Secure and reliable network access to remote knowledge graphs
* Active Context can include concepts from multiple remote sources
* Network failures handled gracefully with appropriate fallbacks

## Visualization

The Knowledge Engine provides a web-based visualization tool for exploring the knowledge graph in real time.

* **Graph Layout:**
  Concepts, code files, documentation, configuration, and other node types are rendered as colored nodes in a force-directed graph.
* **Sidebar Info:**
  Selecting a node shows its summary, content, and all outgoing/incoming relations in a sidebar.
* **Node Types Legend:**
  Different node types (e.g., Code Files, Documentation, Configuration, Images, Concepts, Other) are color-coded for clarity.
* **Relations:**
  Clicking on relations or nodes traverses the graph and updates the context.
* **Search and Filter:**
  Quickly locate nodes using the search bar at the top.

> **Tip:** The visualization updates live as the graph changes, allowing both human users and LLMs to understand project structure and navigate connections.
